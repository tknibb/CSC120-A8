Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

I worked with Julie and Kim.

- Tell me about your class! What does it represent?
    - We made an alien class that represents our alien friend that is exploring a plane and picking up, dropping, examining, and using items and walking and flying around. The alien can also shrink and grow. The alien is also running out of energy as it completes its tasks so there is a rest() method that refuels its energy level. 
- What additional methods (if any) did you implement alongside those listed in the interface?
    - We created accessor methods for all the attributes and we created a move() method and a flyTo() method because we realized that the walk() and fly() methods just return booleans but dont actually do any real action. 
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
    - What worked for me was talking through what we were going to code before we did anything. Another thing that worked was doing one thing at a time and focusing on the main objective at hand so that we don't stress about code that is for the future. What doesn't work is giving up before you consult with others and making a plan. The best advice I have for someone taking this course in the future is to collaborate because multiple brains is better than one.
